If you're unhappy about the response you got, for example if ...

*   ... You didn't get a reply within 20 working days **or**
*   ... You did not get all of the information that you requested **or**
*   ... Your request was rejected, but without a reason valid under the law

## <a name="complaining" /> Either ... Lodge a complaint and request an Ombudsman investigates [#](#complaining)

You can find information on [Official Information Complaints](http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/make-a-complaint/complaining-about-access-to-official-information-551307291224432) on the Office of the Ombudsman's website.

To make it easier for the Ombudsman, include a link to your request on FYI in your complaint or print out the whole page of your request and all attachments.

FYI currently has no special facilities for handling a request at this stage - it passes into the Office of the Ombudsman's system. You can leave annotations on your request keeping people informed of progress.

## <a name="other_means" /> Or ... Use other means to answer your question [#](#other_means)

You can try pursuing your problem or your research in other ways:

*   Make a **new OIA request** for summary information, or for documentation relating indirectly to matters in your rejected request. [Ask us for ideas](https://fyi.org.nz/help/contact) if you're stuck.
*   If any **other public authorities** or publicly owned companies are involved, then make OIA requests to them.
*   Write to **your MP**, **the Minister responsible** or any other politician using the [New Zealand Parliament](https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/contact-an-mp/) website. MPs can write directly to ministers or departments, and can ask written questions in parliament.
