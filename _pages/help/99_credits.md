## <a name="thanks" />What made FYI possible? [#](#thanks)

*   Originally brought to life by the heroic [Rowan Crawford](http://twitter.com/wombleton)
*   FYI.org.nz runs [Alaveteli](http://alaveteli.org), software created and released open-source by [MySociety](http://mysociety.org).
*   [The New Zealand Herald](http://nzherald.co.nz) supports the hosting of FYI.org.nz

## <a name="nzherald" />What relationship does FYI have with the New Zealand Herald? [#](#nzherald)

*   The New Zealand Herald is providing hosting and technical support for the operation of the FYI.org.nz website. The Herald has offered this support because it believes that the Official Information Act is an important institution and that this website is a valuable public service.
*   FYI is an Open NZ project, and run by volunteers independent of The New Zealand Herald. The Herald will never interfere in the operation and administration of the site or any OIA Requests made through the site, nor does the Herald prevent anyone from using FYI.org.nz

## <a name="helpus" />Can I help out? [#](#helpus)

Yes please! We're built out of our supporters and volunteers.

*   Help people find successful requests, and monitor performance of authorities, by [playing the categorisation game](https://fyi.org.nz/categorise/play).
*   Find out OIA email addresses of [authorities that we're missing](/help/making-requests#missing_body).
*   Write a blog post about either FYI or an interesting request that you've found. Post about it on a forum that you frequent. Tell friends about it.
*   If you're a programmer, get the source code for our parent project, [Alaveteli](http://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli) and tell us about patches we can pull. It's made in Ruby on Rails.
*   Get involved with the [Open Government Ninjas](http://groups.open.org.nz/groups/ninja-talk).
