The change in Government this coming week has given us time to consider how users of FYI.org.nz make requests to Ministers, Associate Ministers and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries.

In the past few years, we’ve seen an increase in the number of people assigned roles in the latter two functions, and based on recent media reports, there will be more.  This creates a challenge for the old way of doing things where we worked on the assumption that there is 1 Minister, 0-1 Associate Ministers and 0-1 Parliamentary Under-Secretary.  Some roles are naturally quite large, or there is a desire to spread the work and we’ve started seeing portfolios such as Education getting split amongst 4 people.

Having requestable ‘authorities’ for simply “Minister of Education”, “Associate Minister of Education” and “Parliamentary Under-Secretary” no longer cut the mustard.  In fact, the last time we updated the Ministerial authorities, we left the Associate portfolios alone because we just had no idea.

We now have the chance to put things right, once the old Ministerial warrants for the Caretaker/Old Government are resigned we will start implementing the following plan:

1.  All old Ministerial authorities (i.e. Minister of Education, Minister of Transport, NOT Ministry of Education, Land Transport New Zealand) will be marked as ‘defunct’.  New requests will not be able to be filed to these entities, these will be kept as archives.
2.  We will start creating new Ministerial authorities for every individual Minister, Associate Minister and Parliamentary Under-Secretary.

    These new authorities will be in the form of “Minister for Sunshine (James Gordon)”, “Associate Minister for Sunshine (Kate Kane)”, “Associate Minister for Sunshine (Jack Ryder)”, “Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Sunshine (Harley Quinn)”, etc.  (We find it unlikely there will be a Minister for Sunshine however)

    We are unsure how long this will take, as it’s plausible that not all e-mail addresses will be published immediately.  In case we cannot complete this process in one go, we will post updates at our [post-General Election 2017 Updates page](/election-2017/).
3.  You’ll be able to make requests to the new authorities!

We envision that requests that are still pending responses from Ministers about to resign their Ministerial warrants will be transferred properly, as required, if however you don’t hear anything and the request is still pending, feel free to report the request for Administrator Attention and we can move the request and attempt to rectify the situation.

We hope this will make FYI.org.nz easier to use, and create better historical records of to whom records were originally filed to, and also make our job easier during reshuffles, resulting in quicker updates, and fewer OIA transfers.
